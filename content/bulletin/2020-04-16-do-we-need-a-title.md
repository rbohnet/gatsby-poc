***Special Welcome!*** â€“ to Doug and Sheryl Braaten. 

They have been serving in the mission field for many years and are now living in Canada, working with Teach Beyond. They will be sharing with us briefly during the morning service and then taking the whole service tonight at 6:00 p.m. Please come and hear what the Lord has been doing through their ministry.
