__Office Information__ - We are still working in the office and will
answer emails if you have any questions; the website is a great
resource for keeping up to date on what is happening.

__Tithes and Offerings__ - For receiving your tithes and offerings we
have installed a secure drop box in the metal west facing door of
the church accessible from 1st ave. You can place your donation
in this box, which will be checked throughout the week. As well
donations can be made through an e-transfer at
donations@parkdalegrace.ca or John is willing to come and pick
up your offering envelope from your home if you contact him
directly (403.274.1601).
