*Office Information* - We are still working in the office and will answer emails if you have any questions; the website is a great




resource for keeping up to date on what is happening.
Good Friday â€“ There will be no Good Friday service or potluck
here at the church on Friday the 10th. However, we will be live
streaming the sermon. We will keep you posted with details and
the link to the live stream through an email this coming week.
The link will also be made available on the homepage of our
website later in the week.
Tithes and Offerings - For receiving your tithes and offerings we
have installed a secure drop box in the metal west facing door of
the church accessible from 1st ave. You can place your donation
in this box, which will be checked throughout the week. As well
donations can be made through an e-transfer at
donations@parkdalegrace.ca or John is willing to come and pick
up your offering envelope from your home if you contact him
directly (403.274.1601).
